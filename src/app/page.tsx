    text: "I can't say enough good things about INRI Paint & Wall LLC! From the moment I called them, I felt like they really cared. They painted my kitchen cabinets in a beautiful, clean royal blue that just transformed the whole space. The job was neat, fast, and super professional. I also had some drywall repair done in my hallway and the family room wow!!, I couldn't even tell there was ever damage! I feel like my home has a brand new vibe now. So if you need a professional painter in Garland, don't even think twice! The quality of their drywall repair work is top-notch. It's so hard to find people that truly care and go the extra mile.",
